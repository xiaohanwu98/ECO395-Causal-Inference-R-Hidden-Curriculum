\section{The First Section}

This is where I talk about basic \LaTeX. Using the \texttt{parskip} package, I can create a new paragraph by using line breaks, which I will do now.

I can also make cool equations inline by using parentheses{\textemdash}like this: \(x + 2\){\textemdash}or by using single dollar signs{\textemdash}like this: $x+2$. Parentheses are preferred because the left and right delimiter are distinct.

I can make cool equations in a block style by using the \texttt{equation} environment like so:
\begin{equation*}
    y = x\beta + \varepsilon
\end{equation*}
or by using double dollar signs:
$$
    y = x\beta + \varepsilon
$$

Again, the \texttt{equation} environment is preferred because the begin and end delimiters are different.

I can also add a bibliography, but this is beyond the scope of our discussion right now. Overleaf has plenty of resources for this on their \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn}{website}. Another good place to look for LaTeX help is the \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}{WikiBook} on it.

\section{The Second Section}

Wherein we do tables and graphs. To include the graph we made in ggplot, we create the \texttt{figure} environment. The `H' option tells LaTeX to `hold' the position of the figure instead of positioning it somewhere else. I use the \texttt{caption} command to add a caption{\textemdash}although I also put a title on the plot in ggplot so you would typically choose one or the other. I use the \texttt{label} command after the caption to add a label. Then in my paper I can use the \texttt{ref} command and LaTeX knows I am referring to Figure \ref{fig:graph}.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{incarcerations_by_racegender}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Mean Number of Incarcerations in 2002 by Race and Gender (this is the LaTeX caption, not the ggplot title)}
    \label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}


Tables are somewhat easier, since \texttt{kableExtra} and \texttt{stargazer} generate LaTeX code that is ready to just ``copy-paste'' into our document. The \texttt{label} argument in the R code is the label that the table will have in the tex output, if you want to \texttt{ref} it.
